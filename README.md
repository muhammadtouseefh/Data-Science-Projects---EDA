# Data-Science-Projects EDA

Author:  [Muhammad Anas](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/)

This repo contaoins the projects I've done over the course of time for praticing my EDA and Data Science Skills. You can check the code out and also learn from these projects. Some projects are mainly focused on data cleaning and some on data visualizaion, and yes some even contain both, for instance the [StackOverFlow EDA](https://github.com/muhammadanas0716/Data-Science-Projects---EDA/blob/main/14.%20StackOverFlow%20Survey%202021%20-%20Analysis/Stackoverflow_Developer_Survey_2021_Analysis.ipynb), I did contains a lot of data cleaning & explortation. It also has many visualizations done!
